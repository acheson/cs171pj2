By default, this page shows the total views of the IMDb top 250 films as streamed by 1Channel.ch.  Interacting with the titles list will filter the data and update all views.  Individual titles can be selected by clicking, multiple by click-drag.  More granular selections made by command or control clicks.  The scatter plot supports brushing and seletion of indiviudal titles.  Both the map and bar chart will highlight individual elements and present more detailed site information<br/></p></div>
            <div id="footer-right"><h2>Description</h2>If we are to draw informed conclusions about the issue of online piracy, we need to better understand the darker corners of the web that are contributing to it.  For our project, we want to explore content-indexing websites, a method of illicit content distribution, to understand where and how content is being shared through this method, and who the key players are that are involved in making this distribution model work.  To explore this issue, we want to focus on one particular online distribution model, content-indexing websites, and to limit our dataset, one website: 1channel.ch.  Among the various content-indexing websites, 1channel had the highest Alexa rank (297, 167(!) in the US).  Users on 1channel can access over 49,000 movies and over 6,000 TV shows, all for “free.”  Some of the most popular movies on the site have over 1,000,000 views.  We are going to be scraping 1channel.ch for the top 250 films on IMDB, using a Python script.  At a very high level, our script will do the following:  Retrieve the top 250 films from IMDB. Open 1channel.ch and build a search string for the movie.  Open the search results page and grab the appropriate movie data.  Retrieve the list of third party links and the number of times they have been viewed.  A video about our project can be found here. <a href="http://www.robacheson.com">Watch Now</a>
